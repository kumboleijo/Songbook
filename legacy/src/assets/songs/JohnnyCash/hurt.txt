{c:1. Verse:}
I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain, the only thing thats real

The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away, but I rem[C]ember [D]every[G]thing

{c:Chorus:}
{soc}
[Am]What Have I be[F]come, [C]  my sweetest [G]friend
[Am]Everyone I [F]know, goes a[C]way in the [G]end

And [Am]you could have it [F]all, [C]my empire of [G]dirt
[Am]I will let you [F]down, [G]I will make you [Am]hurt
{eoc}

{c:2. Verse:}
I  wear this crown of thorns, upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts, I cannot repair


Beneath the stains of time, the feeling disappears
You are someone else, [C]I am [D]still right [G]here

{c:Chorus:}
{soc}
[Am]What Have I be[F]come, [C]  my sweetest [G]friend
[Am]Everyone I [F]know, goes a[C]way in the [G]end

And [Am]you could have it [F]all, [C]my empire of [G]dirt
[Am]I will let you [F]down, [C]I will make you [G]hurt

If [Am]I could start ag[F]ain, [C] a million miles aw[G]ay
[Am]I would keep myself, [F]I would [G]find a way[Am].
{eoc}
